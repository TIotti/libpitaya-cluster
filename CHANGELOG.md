# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project follows loosely the [semantic versioning scheme](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The project differs in that Major bumps in the version number do not necessarily break all interfaces. 
Since this library is going to be used in different programming languages, 
bumping a major version may not necessarily break the interface for all programming languages.
Therefore it is important to read the release notes to see which interfaces are broken.

## [Unreleased]

- Asynchronous gRPC server.
- Kick and Push to User implementation for NATS and gRPC RPC clients.
