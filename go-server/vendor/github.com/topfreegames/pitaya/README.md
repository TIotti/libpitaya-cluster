# Attention

Pitaya is currently under development and is not yet ready for production use.
We're working on tests and better documentation and we'll update the project as soon as possible.

Pitaya is an easy to use, fast and lightweight game server framework inspired by [starx](https://github.com/lonnng/starx) and [pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo) and built on top of [nano](https://github.com/lonnng/nano)'s networking library.

The goal of pitaya is to provide a basic development framework for distributed multiplayer games and server-side applications.

## How to build a system with `pitaya`

#### What does a `pitaya` application look like?

A `pitaya` application is a collection of components made of handlers and/or remotes. Handlers are methods that will be called directly by the client while remotes are called by other servers via RPCs. Once you register a component to pitaya, pitaya will register to its service container all methods that can be converted to `Handler` or `Remote`. Pitaya service handler will be called when the client makes a request and it receives two parameters while handling a message:
  - `*session.Session`: corresponding a client that apply this request or notify.
  - `pointer or []byte`: the payload of the request.

When the server has processed the logic, it must return a struct that will be serialized and sent to the client.

#### Standalone application

The easiest way of running `pitaya` is by starting a standalone application. There's an working example [here](./examples/demo/tadpole).

#### Cluster mode

In order to run several `pitaya` applications in a cluster it is necessary to configure RPC and Service Discovery services. Currently we are using [NATS](https://nats.io/) for RPC and [ETCD](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) for service discovery. Other options may be implemented in the future.


There's an working example of `pitaya` running in cluster mode [here](./examples/demo/cluster).

To run this example you need to have both nats and etcd running. To start them you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker run -p 4222:4222 -d --name nats-main nats
docker run -d -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 appcelerator/etcd
```

You can start the backend and frontend servers with the following commands:

```make
make run-cluster-example-frontend
make run-cluster-example-backend
```

##### Frontend and backend servers

In short, frontend servers handle client calls while backend servers only handle RPCs coming from other servers.
